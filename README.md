Hi,
I am a developer who started coding at an age of 17. My interest in coding was generated from playing computer games and creating simple mods for the games. Following my interest, i enrolled in engineering to learn more about the computers. 
I like to design simple yet innovative solutions to tackle the problems faced in daily life to make it simpler. In my free time, I am usually reading tech blogs or novels.
Apart from this, I have an understanding of Python as well.
